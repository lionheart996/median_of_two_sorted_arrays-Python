Median of Two Sorted Arrays

Problem Description
This repository contains a solution to the classic Median of Two Sorted Arrays problem. Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of sizes m and n, the goal is to find the median of the combined sorted array. The solution is optimized to run in O(log(m + n)) time complexity.

Problem Statement
Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2, return the median of the two sorted arrays. The median is defined as:

Odd length: The middle element in the sorted combined array.
Even length: The average of the two middle elements in the sorted combined array.
